# Library Management System
This project is made by using java swing gui and mysql database for storing all the data.Managing records of student and books are quite difficult for a organization so this project help them for managing all the records by using a single software.This project is very useful for school, college and private libraries<br/>


> **Note**
> If you are a noob in programming world than must see project source code to inspire yourself because now a day 
> i have experience of Solid Design Pattern and i usually break the code into small pieces and always try to write maximum 4-5 lines of  code in a function but in the starting of my programming carrer i had developed this project which contains around 5000+ lines of code without using functions except main function (Pffff).<br/>
